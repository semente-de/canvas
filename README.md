# semente canvas

**[semente](https://semente.de)** is a toolkit in the making to co-create community-based digital policy. It is informed by decades of digital rights activism in Brazil and the intention to regenerate fair and inclusive futures with the critical appropriation of digital technologies. semente is based on a canvas to help identify and dynamically shape the intentions and desires of a particular community around project ideas.

In its current version (April 2023), the semente canvas/board has 4 main areas: soil, handling, time and fruits. It has also two additional areas: ethos/principles, and dilemmas.


The semente canvas was designed by Bernardo van de Schepop and Instituto Neos with support from the University of Bristol.
